                                             Bulletin C 42
                                
                                             To authorities responsible                   
                                             for the measurement and 
                                             distribution of time             
                                                                                        


                          INFORMATION ON UTC - TAI
                      

 NO positive leap second will be introduced at the end of December 2011.
 The difference between Coordinated Universal Time UTC and the 
 International Atomic Time TAI is :		
		
     from 2009 January 1, 0h UTC, until further notice : UTC-TAI = -34 s

 Leap seconds can be introduced in UTC at the end of the months of December 
 or June,  depending on the evolution of UT1-TAI. Bulletin C is mailed every  
 six months, either to announce a time step in UTC, or to confirm that there 
 will be no time step at the next possible date.

IMPORTANT: After years of discussions, a proposal to fundamentally redefine 
UTC will come to a conclusive vote in January 2012 at the ITU-R in Geneva. 

This proposal would halt the intercalary adjustments known as leap seconds 
that maintain UTC as a form of Universal Time.

The Earth Orientation Center of the IERS organizes a survey online with the 
objective to find out the strength of opinion for maintaining or changing 
the present system.
