 NO leap second will be introduced at the end of June 2016.
 The difference between Coordinated Universal Time UTC and the 
 International Atomic Time TAI is :		
		
     from 2015 July 1, 0h UTC, until further notice : UTC-TAI = -36 s

 Leap seconds can be introduced in UTC at the end of the months of December 
 or June,  depending on the evolution of UT1-TAI. Bulletin C is mailed every  
 six months, either to announce a time step in UTC, or to confirm that there 
 will be no time step at the next possible date.
