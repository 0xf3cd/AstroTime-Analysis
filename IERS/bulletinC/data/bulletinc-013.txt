                                    UTC TIME STEP
                      
                             on the  1st of  July 1997
              


 A positive leap second will be introduced at the end of June 1997.
 The sequence of dates of the UTC second markers will be:

		
                      1997 June       30,    23h 59mn 59s
                      1997 June       30,    23h 59mn 60s
                      1997 July        1,     0h  0mn  0s

 The difference between UTC and the International Atomic Time TAI is:

   from 1996 January 1, 0h UTC, until 1997 July 1, 0h UTC: UTC-TAI = - 30s
   from 1997 July 1, 0h UTC, until further notice        : UTC-TAI = - 31s

 Leap seconds can be introduced in UTC at the end of the months of December 
 or June, depending on the evolution of UT1-TAI. Bulletin C is mailed every
 six  months, either to announce a time step in UTC, or to confirm that
 there  will  be no time step at the next possible date.
