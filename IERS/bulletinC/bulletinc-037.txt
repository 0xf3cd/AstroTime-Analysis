 NO positive leap second will be introduced at the end of June 2009.

 International Atomic Time TAI is :		
		
     from 2009 January 1, 0h UTC, until further notice : UTC-TAI = -34 s

 Leap seconds can be introduced in UTC at the end of the months of December 
 or June,  depending on the evolution of UT1-TAI. Bulletin C is mailed every  
 six months, either to announce a time step in UTC, or to confirm that there 
 will be no time step at the next possible date.
